## Project considerations

### Remeber to take brakes

You will get tired, and confused. Stay consistent and you will learn.

### Code along with the instructor

I do this already - but you must code along with the instructor.

### Take notes

Buy a notebook and take notes on paper.

### Try all the coding challenges

### Before moving on from a sction, make sure that you understand exactly what was covered

Take a break, review the code that was written, review the notes, review the projects that were built, review the challenges and your solution.
